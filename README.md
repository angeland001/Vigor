## neural_networks/visualizer.py (Explanation)

Visualizes movement data (joints) over time, representing the results of human movement of data generated by kinect.


## neural_networks/prediction_visualizer.py (Explanation)

Visualizes movement data (joints) over time, representing the results of a neural network prediction.

## neural_networks/temporal_cnn.py (Explanation)

Machine Learning Model built using Keras for predicting joint Cartesian coordinates based on a walking sequence provided in a JSON file. 

* Iterates through the joint Cartesian data to create input sequences (X) and corresponding labels (y) for training.
* Reshape the data into NumPy arrays.
